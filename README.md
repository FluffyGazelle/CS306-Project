We changed our dataset because we had some difficulties while looking for 5 entities. Although we found 5 entities, after the submission it is said that we should find 5 entities apart from Country and Continent. Therefore, we decided to collect data on various risk factors of deaths. For this, we downloaded 1 dataset called “Number of deaths by risk factor, World” under the title “Obesity”.

Deleted attributes from original dataset:
● High systolic blood pressure
● Secondhand smoke
● Unsafe sex
● Low physical activity
● High fasting plasma glucose
● High body-mass index
● Iron deficiency
● Child stunting
● Vitamin A deficiency
● Low bone mineral density
